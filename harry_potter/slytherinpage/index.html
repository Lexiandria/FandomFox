 <h2 style="font-size:35pt; color:#dedfe0;">History of Slytherin</h2>
 <p style="color:#dedfe0;">Slytherin is one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar<br>Slytherin. Salazar instructed the sorting hat to choose a few particular characteristics he most valued. Such character traits are<br>cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition (mostly of pure-blood pure-blood supremacy, due to his mistrust of Muggle-borns). Its<br>emblematic animal is a snake and its colours are green and silver. The Head of<br>Slytherin is Horace Slughorn (who left the role to Severus Snape for fifteen years before taking it up again in 1996) and the House's<br>patron ghost is the Bloody Baron.
<br>
<br>
Slytherin corresponds roughly with the element of water with serpents being<br>commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology,<br>as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals.<br>The colours also correspond with waters around lakes and lochs often being green, and silver<br>being often associated with grey rain water.</p>
