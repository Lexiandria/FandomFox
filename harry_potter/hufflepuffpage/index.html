  <p style="color:#873502">Hufflepuff is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff.<br>Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience,<br>loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. The emblematic animal is a badger,<br>and yellow and black are its colours. The Head of Hufflepuff is Pomona Sprout and the Fat Friar is the House's patron ghost.
<br>
<br>
Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth, and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen:<br>yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil.<br>The Hufflepuff points hourglass contains yellow diamonds.<br>Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrate exceptional abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.</p>
